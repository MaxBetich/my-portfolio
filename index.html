    <h2><span class="section">About Me</span></h2>
    <p>I like to think I've traveled an interesting path in life to get where I am now: I've lived in a lot
      of different places, met a lot of different kinds of people, and done a lot of different things to make
      a living. In the course of those travels, an old friend talked about how learning to code opened up a 
      great opportunity for him, and I felt like it was worth my time to see what I could learn. I've found 
      the process fascinating so far!

    <h4>Interests, Hobbies, Skills</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Hiking</em></li>
      <p>I've hiked up and around several of the Cascade Range mountains, and seen some gorgeous views during
        my time in the Wallowas in eastern Oregon. I would love to climb North Sister to finish off the trio 
        some day, as well as explore Mt. Shasta.
      </p>
      <li><em>Miniature Modeling</em></li>
      <p>My parents and relatives kept me well supplied with various lego sets as a kid, and that enthusiasm 
        for building and fine detail work has led me to amass a sizeable collection of plastic model kits over 
        the years. I only consider a project to be truly finished when I've sliced open a finger with a modeling 
        knife and glued two or more fingers together in the pursuit of perfection!
      </p>
      <li><em>Roleplaying Games</em></li>
      <p>I've been a fan of games like Dungeons and Dragons since I was first exposed to them back in middle 
        school. To me, they're a great creative outlet and socialization tool, and I often find myself working on
        my collection of silly voices or dramatic flourishes in my idle moments. I've also met some amazing people 
        through these games, and with the evolution of online social tools, I've gotten the opportunity to play 
        with like-minded fans from literally all around the world.
